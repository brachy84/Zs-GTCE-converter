# Script Converter for GTCE - GTCEu
This script converter was made out of boredom and with the goal to easily convert GTCE modpacks to GTCEu.
It simply converts most item brackets to proper metaitem brackts which are compatible with gtceu.

It can also convert BetterQuesting json files.

The converter was developed with Java 8 and runs fine. No deps needed.

If you are not sure what to do with this or how to use it, you can send me your script folder on Discord (brachy84#4433) and i'll do it for you.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.
